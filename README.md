Smart Display Accessibility Mode (S-DAM)
=====================

Description 
-------------
#### This project provides an algorithm that is capable of analyzing, identifying, and segmenting screen content to transform a screenâ€™s image into a more accessible form. By ignoring media like images and video, this technique provides an option for users with contrast or light sensitivity to view graphical content in their original form, thus providing them with an experience similar to what the app developers intended for a user without any vision impairments. 

Prerequisites
--------------
- [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases)
- Python 


Generate S-DAM Ouput
